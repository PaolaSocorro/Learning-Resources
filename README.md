# Learning-Resources

This repo is a way for me to keep track of resources I use to learn programming/ security basics.
Some of these I found, some I received from mentors and/or professinals.

### Security
- [Security Resources](https://github.com/PaolaSocorro/Learning-Resources/blob/master/Security%20Resources.md)



### [How to Structure Large Apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-structure-large-flask-applications)
